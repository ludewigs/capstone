# Little Lemon Capstone Project

This project is the Meta Front-End Developer Capstone, built with Create React App. It implements the booking flow and responsive UI for the Little Lemon Restaurant, using React, Chakra UI, and React Hook Form.

To run the project, first install dependencies with:
npm install

Then start the development server with:
npm start
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000 and will reload automatically when you make changes.

To run the test suite, use:
npm test
This launches Jest in watch mode. Press “a” to run all tests or “q” to quit.

To build the project for production, use:
npm run build
The optimized files will be output in the build folder.

Technologies used include React, Chakra UI, React Hook Form with Yup validation, and Jest with React Testing Library. The app uses fetchAPI and submitAPI to simulate data handling, with bookings stored locally via localStorage.
